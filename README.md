Oh hello! I don't know what it is you're doing here, but welcome I suppose. Here you will find a place where I tinker with various Javascript/React things.

Anyway, if you feel the need to do something with this code then here's how you run this ship:

###Running the ship
1. Clone down this repo from github
2. In a terminal run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. To do other things like actually run the app checkout the scripts info from the base of this app (create-react-app) below:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
